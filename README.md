University of Victoria - CSC 360 Operating Systems (Fall 2014): Project 1

This is an implementation of a realistic shell interpreter (RSI) that uses system calls and interacts with the system. It functions very similar to the Linux shell bash and supports the foreground execution of programs, ability to change directories, and background execution.
